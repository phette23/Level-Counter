# Intro

Basic Munchkin Counter because we need a cross-platform, web-based counter that's free & easy to customize.

[Munchkin](http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/) is a card game, btw. If you don't know what it is then probably very little of this will make sense.

There's a [live, usable version](http://bit.ly/munch-count) on the web.

## HTML5 Boilerplate

I'm using [the HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) as a, um, boilerplate. Once there's a working project with sufficient functionality then I will strip out unused features but for now I'm leaving them in.

## To Do

In rough order of priority.

- Mobile first CSS, redo the layout.
- Store game details in DOM storage, offer to restore previous game if there's content in storage
- Combat page for 1-time bonuses, strength vs. monster
- Better handling of classes & races, possibly including a choice at the beginning of the game wherein you select which decks you're using & the options are presented accordingly
- Finish game: when you hit level 10, do something congratulatory
