# Intro

Basic Munchkin Counter because we need a cross-platform, web-based counter that's free & easy to customize.

[Munchkin](http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/) is a card game, btw. If you don't know what it is then probably very little of this will make sense.

There's a [live, usable version](http://bit.ly/munch-count) on the web.

## HTML5 Boilerplate

I'm using [the HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) as a, um, boilerplate. Once there's a working project with sufficient functionality then I will strip out unused features but for now I'm leaving them in. So there's a link to [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) even though I'm not using it right now.

## To Do

In rough order of priority.

- Mobile testing. Does it work? Looks slightly too tall right now, need to remove some padding
- Combat page for 1-time bonuses, strength vs. monster
- Multiple players on one HTML page? Might not be worth the trouble.
