# Intro

Basic Munchkin Counter because we need a cross-platform, web-based counter that's free & easy to customize.

[Munchkin](http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/) is a card game, by the way. If you don't know what it is then probably very little of this will make sense.

There's a [live, usable version](http://phette.net/munchkin-counter/) on the web.

## HTML5 Boilerplate

I'm using [the HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) as a, um, boilerplate. Once there's a working project with sufficient functionality then I will strip out unused features but for now I'm leaving them in.

## To Do

In rough order of priority.

- Convert to a Yeoman project
- Better layout, use space better on larger screens
- Combat page: "add monster" & "add player" buttons
- Offer to restore previous game if there's content in storage
- Record game progress, offer to chart later (?)

I originally intended to have select options for race & class characteristics but that quickly proved to be too burdensome given the numerous Munchkin expansion packs. If you're interested, there is a "race-class" branch of this repo that contains my initial code. It works fine but does not cover most expansions (e.g. Star Munchkin, Axe Cop Munchkin).
