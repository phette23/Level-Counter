# Tests

To get tests up & running, navigate inside this folder & run:

- `$ virtualenv .` (you'll need virtualenv in your global Python environment)
- `$ pip install selenium`
- is it necessary to install webdriver binary too? I'm not sure but I have it on my system

This is my first time doing testing like this so I'm sure I'm missing something. I'll need to try to get tests running fresh on a clean system to see if these instructions work.
